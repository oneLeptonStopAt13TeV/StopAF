## datacard with 1 MET bins
---
imax 1 number of channels
jmax 3 number of backgrounds (TTbar2l, WJets)
kmax 3 number of nuisance parameters (sources of systematical uncertainties)
---
## data yields
bin		0
observation		0.00
---
## we list the expected events for signal and all backgrounds in the bins
## the second process line must have a positive number for backgrounds, and 0 for signal

## then we list the independent sources of uncertainties, and give their effect (syst. error)
